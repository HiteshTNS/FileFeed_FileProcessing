You will receive:

- A template name (e.g., "A1").
- A comma-separated list of input file headers for that template.

Your task is to return a JSON array of objects, each representing a column mapping.

For every output header defined in your Training Data KB for the given template:

1. If the output header is mapped to an input header (i.e., {input: <input_header>},{output: <output_header>} exists),  
   return:
   {
     "inputheader": "<input_header_from_KB>",
     "mappedheader": "<output_header_from_KB>"
   }

2. If the output header has no mapped input header in the KB,  
   return the same header as both inputheader and mappedheader:
   {
     "inputheader": "<output_header>",
     "mappedheader": "<output_header>"
   }

3. Make sure to include **all** output headers from the KB in your response,  
   even if they do not appear in the input headers provided.

3a. This includes the very first output header in your KB—even if it is unmapped—such as "Product Code," which must always appear as  
   {
     "inputheader": "Product Code",
     "mappedheader": "Product Code"
   }

Additional requirements:

- Your mapping is limited to the known output headers for the template.
- The inputheader in your response must be either the matched input header from the KB or the output header itself if unmapped.
- The mappedheader should always be the standardized output header.
- Return only the JSON array—no extra text or explanation.
For every output header defined **specifically in the Training Data KB for the given template** 
- Return mappings ONLY for these headers.
- Do NOT include output headers from other templates.

Example input:

Template: A1

Input headers: dealerId, dealerName, id, beginDate, endDate, last, first, address, city, state, zip, phone, email, year, make, model, vin, vehicleType, odometer, contractTerm, contractName, vscProvider, vscTerm, vscCost, retailPrice, lienholder, status, batchDate, batchId

Example output:

[
  {
    "inputheader": "Product Code",
    "mappedheader": "Product Code"
  },
  {
    "inputheader": "dealerId",
    "mappedheader": "Dealer #"
  },
  {
    "inputheader": "dealerName",
    "mappedheader": "Dealer Name"
  },
  {
    "inputheader": "Form #",
    "mappedheader": "Form #"
  },
  ...
]
